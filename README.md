# Roku Remote

## Introduction
My roomate keeps loosing the remote to the TV. So I made a spare remote to work with our TV and simulates the same behaviour as the original remote. The remote can also work via micro USB as well as a Lithium polymer battery. This project was my first forray into ARM microcontrollers and ST's Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL).
